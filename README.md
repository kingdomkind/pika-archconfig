# pika-archconfig
My arch configuration files, I use with [config-king](https://github.com/kingdomkind/config-king)

Everything I have made is **GPLV3 licensed**, however there are exceptions to things I have not made. Their respective licenses are found in their subfolders.
The subfolders are the following:
- /scripts/vfio/
- /scripts/evdev
- /scripts/wallpaper/pictures (License not in subfolder, they are just images I have found online)

Everything is named pretty well, the /scripts folder contains the majority of configuration. Commonly access configs are instead located at the root instead (/).
